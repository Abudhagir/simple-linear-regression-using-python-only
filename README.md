# simple-linear-regression-using-python-only

In this nano project, we will build simple but robust linear regression model from scratch in python and use it to predict
relationship between Study hours and GPA. 
Yes, you heard right, no state of the art SciKit Learn, or pandas, scipy or even numpy. Actually we will use no package at all.
This is not to show that these packages are unncesseary (because they totally are wonderful, widely used and much needed packages)
However, the Goal is to show math and beauty of python, and reasoning that all these packages are using similar math and logic
to create highly sustainable Machine Learning models.
